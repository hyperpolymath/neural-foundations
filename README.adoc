== License & Philosophy

This project must declare **MPL-2.0-or-later** for platform/tooling compatibility.

Philosophy: **Palimpsest**. The Palimpsest-MPL (PMPL) text is provided in `license/PMPL-1.0.txt`, and the canonical source is the palimpsest-license repository.

== What is Neural Foundations?

*Neural Foundations* is the primary repository for AI and neural computing *core technologies*—the fundamental building blocks, not their applications.

This repository organizes projects that advance the state of:

* *Foundation Models* — LLM infrastructure, conversation management, semantic primitives
* *Agentic Systems* — Multi-agent orchestration, AI control mechanisms, constraint architectures
* *Neurosymbolic* — Hybrid neural-symbolic systems, spiking networks, reservoir computing

== Philosophy: Technologies, Not Applications

This ecosystem focuses on the *technologies themselves*, not their application to other domains.

== Foundation Models

Repositories focused on Large Language Model infrastructure and conversation management.

=== llm-unify

A unified interface for managing conversations across multiple LLM platforms.
Abstracts provider differences (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) into a consistent API.

=== llm-unify-core

Core types for managing LLM conversations across multiple providers (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot).
Shared type definitions used by llm-unify and other tools.

=== llm-antidote

Universal semantic reset artifacts for language model context management.
Techniques for clearing, resetting, or redirecting LLM context.

=== patallm-gallery

Gallery of LLM patterns and implementations.
Reference architectures and proven patterns for LLM integration.

== Agentic Systems

Repositories focused on multi-agent orchestration and AI control mechanisms.

=== agentic-scm

Agentic architecture patterns in SCM format.
Machine-readable definitions for agent behaviors and interactions.

=== conative-gating

Controlling AI with AI. Introduces a second model trained with inverted incentives—rewarded for blocking, suspicious by default, adversarial to the LLM's proposals.
Uses metaphors from human constraint mechanisms.

=== elegant-state

Local-first state graph for multi-agent orchestration.
Enables agents to coordinate without centralized state management.

== Neurosymbolic Systems

Repositories focused on hybrid neural-symbolic computing, including spiking neural networks and reservoir computing.

=== neurosym-scm

Core patterns and definitions for neurosymbolic systems in SCM format.

=== echidna

*Extensible Cognitive Hybrid Intelligence for Deductive Neural Assistance.*

A neurosymbolic theorem proving platform that transforms Quill (Agda-only neural solver) into a universal multi-prover system with:

* Aspect tagging
* OpenCyc integration
* DeepProbLog probabilistic logic

=== neurophone

Complete Android application for neurosymbolic AI on mobile devices.
Combines spiking neural networks with large language models for advanced on-device intelligence.

=== esn

A Rust implementation of Echo State Networks (reservoir computing) for time series prediction and classification.

=== lsm

A Rust implementation of Liquid State Machines (spiking neural network reservoirs) for temporal pattern recognition.

=== disinfo-nesy-detector

Disinformation and AI-generated content detection using neurosymbolic techniques.

=== zotero-nesy

_"What can be said at all can be said clearly."_ — Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus

Knowledge extraction and semantic analysis for academic research.

== Relationship to Other Primaries

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Primary | Relationship

| *poly-mcps*
| Applications of LLM protocols—MCP servers use neural-foundations technologies

| *rhodium-standard-repositories*
| RSR compliance applies to all neural-foundations satellites

| *oikos*
| AI-powered git analysis uses neural-foundations for its AI capabilities

| *cccp*
| Language policy governs implementation languages (Rust preferred for ESN/LSM)

== Contributing

Contributions should focus on *core technologies*, not applications:

1. New neural network architectures
2. LLM conversation primitives
3. Agent coordination patterns
4. Neurosymbolic reasoning techniques

For AI *applications*, contribute to the appropriate domain-specific repository.
